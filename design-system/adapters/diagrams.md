# Diagrams and schematics

## Choose meaning first

Use a flow for sequence, a tree for hierarchy, a state diagram for transitions, and architecture for components and connections. When behavior carries the meaning, identify the semantic pattern before selecting its visual grammar.

A list belongs in bullets or a table. Attribute comparisons belong in a table. A numerical result belongs in a chart ([data.md](data.md)). Do not draw a one-box diagram that merely repeats a sentence.

## Geometry and hierarchy

Use the profile's 4 px base for structural coordinates and gaps. Default readable labels are 16 px at rendered document size, 36 px on the slide authoring canvas. Type follows the role ramp, not the geometry grid.

Keep connectors orthogonal where applicable, attach points distinct, labels clear of strokes, and masks the actual background color. Draw routes before nodes. Shapes differentiate functional types; identical boxes must not erase hierarchy. Use flat fills and restrained radii.

## Budget and color

Start with an overview budget of about 7–9 nodes, 12 connections, two callouts, and at most two focal elements. It is a comprehension heuristic, not a permission to discard necessary content. Add a detail figure or meaningful zones if required.

Use Blue Slate essential connectors. Orange on Ivory needs a darker outline or another essential marker; it cannot carry a critical route alone. Sage communicates an outcome only with labels or redundant shape cues. No purely color-coded branch logic.

## Source, accessibility, and adaptation

Maintain nodes, edges, groupings, direction, and definitions in editable source. Published SVG needs a unique accessible title and description; complex meaning also needs adjacent prose or structured text. Report merged, omitted, or relocated content in a fidelity ledger.

Check label collisions, clipping, connector routing, final-size text, and print. On phones, recompose simple diagrams vertically; give inherently wide technical diagrams a labelled local scroll area without shrinking below readable type. Motion is optional and must not change static meaning.
